# TaskFlow — Full Stack Task Management System

A full stack task management application built with **Java Spring Boot** on the backend and a modern **dark-themed dashboard UI** on the frontend. Supports complete CRUD operations through both a REST API and an interactive browser interface.

## Overview

What started as a RESTful API has evolved into a complete full stack project. The frontend is a production-grade dashboard with a dark luxury design, real-time table interactions, and full create/edit/delete/view capabilities — all communicating with the Spring Boot backend through the Fetch API.

---

## Features

### Backend
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks
- Retrieve all tasks or a single task by ID
- Automatic task creation timestamp
- Enum-based Priority (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`) and Status (`TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`) fields
- JSON-based REST communication
- Custom exception handling with proper HTTP status codes (404, etc.)

### Frontend
- Dark luxury dashboard UI with animated background and glass surfaces
- Live task table with staggered row animations
- Colour-coded priority and status badges
- Expandable detail rows showing full task info including description
- Create and Edit form with mode switching (Create / Update)
- Task counter, ID lookup, and controlled table loading
- Raw API response panel for debugging
- Fully served from Spring Boot's static resources — no separate server needed

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure **Java JDK 21** is installed
2. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**
3. Run `TaskmanagerApplication.java` as a **Java Application**
4. The embedded Tomcat server starts on **port 8080**

| Interface    | URL                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Dashboard UI | `http://localhost:8080`              |
| REST API     | `http://localhost:8080/api/tasks`    |

---

## API Reference

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8080/api/tasks`

| Method | Endpoint          | Description          | Status |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| POST   | `/api/tasks`      | Create a new task    | 201    |
| GET    | `/api/tasks`      | Get all tasks        | 200    |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Get task by ID       | 200    |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Update a task        | 200    |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/{id}` | Delete a task        | 204    |

**Sample POST body:**
```json
{
  "taskName": "Sample Task",
  "description": "Task description here",
  "assignedUser": "John Doe",
  "dueDate": "2025-12-31",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "status": "TODO"
}
```
> `id` and `createdDate` are auto-generated and should not be included in the request body.

## Database Schema — `task`

| Column        | Type    | Notes                          |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| id            | BIGINT  | Primary key, auto-increment    |
| task_name     | VARCHAR | Required                       |
| description   | VARCHAR |                                |
| assigned_user | VARCHAR |                                |
| due_date      | DATE    |                                |
| priority      | VARCHAR | `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH`      |
| status        | VARCHAR | `TODO` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `DONE`|
| created_date  | DATE    | Auto-generated on first save   |

> Schema is auto-generated by Spring Data JPA at runtime. H2 is in-memory — all data resets on restart.
